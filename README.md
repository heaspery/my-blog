# My blog

This blog was developed for the **LabVeilTech** course at **HEIG-VD**.

## Technologies

It was built with **Hugo** and deployed using **GitHub Pages**.
A live version is available at **[blog.ancay.ch](https://blog.ancay.ch)**.

## Getting started

Clone the project, install dependencies, then run it locally with:

`hugo serve`

## Go further

Check out my other repository, **[my-glance](https://github.com/heaspery/my-glance)**.
It contains my part of the project and serves as the main window for my *veille technologique*.
